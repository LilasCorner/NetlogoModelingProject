trying to model the twitter follow suggestion system and how it influences your own interests

- nodes start as a complete graph
- nodes have internal states of interests (idk 3ish or more with numeric value indicating strenght of interest)
- nodes can see # followers another node has
- directed = person follows, not followed back etc
- every turn, nodes decide to break/make connections with other nodes of similar interests
	- they make connections with those of similar interest
	- they break if they realize another interest is stronger than the one they followed for

- the node's opinion changes based on those it follows -- the higher the follower count of the other node, the stronger the influence on the change.
